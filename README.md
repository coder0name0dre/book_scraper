# Book Scraper

This is a small Python script example that scrapes book details from the example site **books.toscrape.com**. This repository contains a simple scraper (`scrape_books.py`) that fetches book title, price, availability, rating, and the product URL from a single catalogue page and saves the results to `books.csv` and `books.json`.
